# Chapter 11: Humanoid Robot Design and Control

This chapter explores the principles of humanoid robot design, including mechanical structure, actuation systems, and control strategies specific to bipedal and multi-limbed humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the biomechanical principles underlying humanoid robot design
- Learn about different actuation systems for humanoid robots
- Explore balance and locomotion control strategies
- Implement basic humanoid control systems with ROS 2

## Technical Explanation

Humanoid robot design involves creating robots with human-like form and capabilities. This includes considerations for kinematics, dynamics, balance control, and human-robot interaction. The design must account for weight distribution, center of mass, and actuator placement to enable stable locomotion and manipulation.

## Summary

Humanoid robot design combines principles from biomechanics, mechanical engineering, and control theory to create robots that can operate in human environments and interact naturally with human tools and spaces.
