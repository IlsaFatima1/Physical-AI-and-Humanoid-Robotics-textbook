# Chapter 12: Learning and Adaptation in Robotics

This chapter covers machine learning techniques for robotics, including reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and adaptive control methods that enable robots to improve their performance over time.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand different learning paradigms in robotics
- Learn about reinforcement learning for robotic control
- Explore imitation learning and transfer learning techniques
- Implement learning algorithms with ROS 2 and simulation environments

## Technical Explanation

Learning and adaptation in robotics involves using machine learning techniques to enable robots to improve their performance, adapt to new environments, and learn from experience. This includes reinforcement learning for decision-making, imitation learning for skill acquisition, and adaptive control for handling uncertainties.

## Summary

Learning and adaptation techniques enable robots to become more capable and robust by continuously improving their performance based on experience and feedback from the environment.
