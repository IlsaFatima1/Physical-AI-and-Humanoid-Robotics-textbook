# Chapter 13: Multi-Robot Systems and Coordination

This chapter explores the coordination and control of multiple robots working together, including communication protocols, task allocation, and swarm intelligence approaches.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the challenges and benefits of multi-robot systems
- Learn about communication protocols for robot coordination
- Explore task allocation and formation control strategies
- Implement multi-robot coordination with ROS 2

## Technical Explanation

Multi-robot systems involve the coordination of multiple autonomous robots to achieve complex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single robot. This includes considerations for communication, task allocation, formation control, and distributed decision-making.

## Summary

Multi-robot systems leverage the collective capabilities of multiple robots to achieve greater efficiency, robustness, and capability than individual robots working alone.
