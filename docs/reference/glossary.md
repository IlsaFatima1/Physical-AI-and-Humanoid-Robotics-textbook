# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In robotics, APIs enable communication between different components of a robotic system.

### Autonomous Robot
A robot that can operate independently without human intervention, making decisions based on its sensors and programming.

## B

### Behavior Tree
A hierarchical structure used in robotics and AI to define the behavior of autonomous agents. It provides a way to organize and execute complex behaviors in a modular fashion.

## C

### Control System
A system that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems. In robotics, control systems manage the robot's movements and actions.

### Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
A system of collaborating computational elements controlling physical entities, where computation and physical processes are deeply integrated.

## D

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

### Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
The number of independent movements a mechanical system can perform. In robotics, this refers to the number of independent joints or actuators.

## E

### End Effector
The device at the end of a robotic arm that interacts with the environment. This could be a gripper, tool, or sensor.

## F

### Forward Kinematics
The use of joint parameters to compute the configuration of the kinematic chain, i.e., the position and orientation of the end-effector.

## G

### Gazebo
A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides high-fidelity physics simulation and rendering capabilities. It's commonly used for testing and validating robotic algorithms.

## H

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
Software that allows higher-level software to interact with hardware without knowing the details of the hardware's operation.

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with a human-like body structure, typically featuring a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics
The mathematical process of determining the joint parameters needed to position the end-effector at a desired location and orientation.

### Isaac
NVIDIA's robotics platform that provides tools and libraries for developing, simulating, and deploying AI-powered robots.

## J

### Joint Space
The space defined by the joint angles of a robotic manipulator. Control in joint space involves specifying desired joint positions, velocities, or torques.

## K

### Kinematics
The study of motion without considering the forces that cause the motion. In robotics, it deals with the geometric relationships between the parts of a mechanism.

## L

### Localization
The process by which a robot determines its position and orientation relative to its environment.

## M

### Manipulator
A robotic device designed to manipulate objects in its environment, typically featuring multiple joints and an end effector.

### Mapping
The process of creating a representation of the environment that a robot can use for navigation and planning.

## N

### Navigation
The process by which a robot plans and executes a path from its current location to a desired destination while avoiding obstacles.

## O

### Odometry
The use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time. In robotics, it's commonly used to track a robot's position relative to a starting location.

## P

### Path Planning
The computational problem of finding a valid sequence of configurations that moves an object from an initial configuration to a goal configuration without colliding with obstacles.

### Perception
The ability of a robot to interpret and understand its environment through sensors such as cameras, lidars, and other sensing modalities.

## R

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

### ROS 2
The second generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to be suitable for production environments and to support multiple operating systems.

### ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
The ROS 2 distribution released in May 2022, with long-term support until May 2027. It's the recommended version for this textbook.

### ROS Package
A collection of files organized to perform specific tasks in ROS. A package contains libraries, executables, scripts, or other artifacts.

## S

### Sensor Fusion
The process of combining data from multiple sensors to achieve improved accuracy and reliability compared to using a single sensor.

### Simulation
The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time, commonly used in robotics for testing and development.

## T

### TF (Transforms)
A package in ROS that keeps track of multiple coordinate frames over time. It's used to answer questions like "What is the position of the base of the robot in the world frame?"

### Trajectory Planning
The process of creating a path that specifies position, velocity, and acceleration over time.

## U

### URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
An XML format for representing a robot model in ROS. It describes the physical and visual properties of a robot, including links, joints, and other components.

### Unity
A cross-platform game engine that can be used for creating 3D simulations for robotics applications.

## V

### VLA (Vision-Language-Action)
A multimodal AI model that combines visual, language, and action capabilities to enable robots to understand and execute complex tasks based on natural language instructions.

### Visual Servoing
A control strategy that uses visual feedback to control the motion of a robot, typically to position an end effector relative to an object.

## X

### XACRO
An XML macro language that extends URDF with features like constants, property substitution, and simple math expressions to make complex robot descriptions more manageable.

## Y

## Z
